    <h3>Little bit about me...</h3>
    <p>After spending some time in the service industry and sales, I began to feel the urge to seek out a new path. I started coding about a year ago and immediately fell in love with JavaScript. The challenge of learning how to code and develop websites brought a new sense of energy and fulfillment into my life. I am looking to continue this journey by officially starting a career in web development. I am looking to work for a small or medium-sized company where I can continue to learn and thrive in an exciting environment.</p>
